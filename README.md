# Brute Force Project
This project was carried out in class where I implemented a brute force attack to discover a password assigned by the professor. The attack was performed using multiple threads to test different password combinations simultaneously.

## Description
The program performs a brute force attack on a web server by sending HTTP POST requests with different password combinations. It uses HttpClient to send the requests and ThreadPool to handle multiple threads to speed up the testing process.

## Requirements
.NET Core SDK
Internet connection
Permission to perform security testing on the target server
